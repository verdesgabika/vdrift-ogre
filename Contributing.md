<blockquote>Also new data like tracks, objects, textures, sounds etc. don't need be done like this.<br>
Can be just uploaded as attachments on Forum.</blockquote>

This page describes the procedure to get your code (fixes, patches, new features, media etc.) included into Stunt Rally.<br>
<i>This assumes you have already cloned our code and done something with it and now are ready to share your stuff.</i>

If you don't know what to do, but want to help,<br>
check out the page <a href='http://code.google.com/p/vdrift-ogre/issues/list'>Issues</a> with programming tasks (sorted by priority) and some descriptions,<br>
and also <a href='Roadmap.md'>Roadmap</a> for next version.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<ul><li><a href='http://git-scm.com/'>Git</a> version control software<br>
</li><li><a href='https://github.com/signup/free'>GitHub account</a>, it's free (our code is hosted there)<br>
</li><li>Preferably some prior Git knowledge.<br>There is a lot of Git tutorials on internet, also we can help you on our IRC channel.</li></ul>

<h3>Set up Git</h3>

If this is the first time you use Git, setup your name and email:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "My Name"<br>
$ git config --global user.email "myemail@example.com"<br>
</code></pre>

You also need to generate ssh keys and setup them on GitHub to push there.<br>
See how to on <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-linux'>Linux</a> or <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-windows'>Windows</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Workflow</h3>

A simpler way is to make patches, but only for really small things.<br>
<br>
Forking is made possible by GitHub and is great for first contributions.<br>
In the long run, we probably let you commit directly to our repo, which saves everyone's time.<br>
(Preferably in a branch, since CryHam doesn't like surprises, on master).<br>
<br>
<ol><li><a href='http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/'>Fork</a> our repository at GitHub (done once)<br>
</li><li>Clone it (done once)<br>
</li><li>Develop it (fix, modify or add your new stuff)<br>
</li><li>Test it.<br>
</li><li><i>If you added new files use <code>git add</code></i>
</li><li>Commit your changes: <code>git commit -a -m "Implemented something"</code> <i>(or "Fixed a crash when..", etc.)</i>
</li><li>Push the code to GitHub: <code>git push</code>
</li><li>Create a <a href='http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/'>pull request</a> on GitHub<br>
</li><li>To make sure we notice it, tell us on IRC (#stuntrally @ freenode)<br>
</li><li><i>Rest.</i> <i>(or praise the Lord and pass the ammunition)</i>
</li><li>Go back to 3.</li></ol>

<blockquote>Note: it is likely that work still needs to be done before it will be accepted.<br>
Also, it is possible that it won't be accepted by CryHam at all (if it doesn't fit SR).<br>
Thus, it's probably best to talk on IRC before.</blockquote>

If you work on our repo (without fork) points 1 and 8 are gone.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i>An artificial feedback loop appears between 3-4, and sometimes between 5-7 (forgot to add),</i><br>
Point 9 appears randomly between all of others, and imaginary points 0 and 12 start to appear later.<br>
And none of this would happen if we had gone fishing.<i></blockquote></i>

Have fun <i>(usually between 3 and 4).</i>
