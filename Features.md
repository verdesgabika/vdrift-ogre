This page lists available features in game and editor.

## Game Modes ##

  * Single Race - with 167 Tracks to drive on, in 34 sceneries - over 5 hours to drive all
    * Ghost drive - chase your best time car on track
    * Track's ghost - best drive for track, a green ghost car ES, on all tracks (not reversed)
    * Replays - save your drive and watch it from other cameras later

  * Tutorials - few short and easy tracks to show various track elements
  * Championships - usually long series of tracks, drive to get higher score, if too low repeat a stage
  * Challenges - few tracks, quite difficult to pass, game already set up.<br>Drive with no mistakes to win bronze, silver or gold prize.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Split Screen - 2 to 4 players on 1 screen <i>(requires a good GPU, it's best to reduce graphics options)</i>
</li><li>Multiplayer - single races over internet, in-game chat, (see <a href='NetworkMultiplayer.md'>Wiki</a>)</li></ul>

<h3>Gameplay ###

  * Simulation modes: Easy (beginner) and Normal
  * Stunt tracks having: jumps, loops, pipes or very twisted road
  * Choose from 19 cars (ES is best for rally), few are quite exotic
  * Other vehicles: hovering spaceships, bouncy sphere
  * Drives through water or mud areas
  * Dynamic objects on tracks (barrels, boxes, etc), can be hit with car

### Input ###

  * Game controllers support (gamepad, steering wheel, joystick etc.)
  * Input configuring (reassign keys, change sensitivity)

### Gui and HUD ###

  * Minimap, can be zoomed and rotated
  * Driving aids
    * arrow to next check point
    * next check point beam
    * track completion percentage
    * time difference and current points shown on each checkpoint
  * Detailed list of tracks with:
    * ratings and stats (eg. difficulty, length, width, and much more)
    * preview image and minimap
  * Several gauge types (rpm and velocity)

### Graphics ###

  * 8 Graphics presets for quick change to match hardware performance
  * Many graphics options to tweak each feature individually
  * Terrain parallax and triplanar mapping
  * Car/water reflections and fresnel, water refraction
  * Various effects (but significantly lower performance):
    * bloom, motion blur, ssao (ambient shadows)
    * _slightly broken: depth of field, god rays, HDR_

## Track Editor ##

  * Spline based road - no predefined sets or tiles, giving road absolute freedom in 3D, smoothed between points
  * Real-time editing of road points and their parameters - quick adjusting with keys or mouse to see how it looks
  * Changing all of track parameters in editor (no other tools needed), after each save track is ready to play in game

  * Several brushes for terrain editing (87 total)
  * Terrain generator with many parameters

  * In-editor Help page with all key shortcuts and mouse actions listed
  * Console tab, listing track errors, warnings and hints on save
  * [Wiki page](TrackEditor.md) and video tutorials available
  * No undo - using quick save and quick load

### Car editing ###
  * In game car editor allows faster tinkering with simulation parameters<br>and aids creating new cars, <a href='CarEditing.md'>Wiki here</a>
<ul><li>Many graphs (visualizations) of key car simulation values<br>
</li><li>Tire functions (Pacejka magic formula) editing while driving
