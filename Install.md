## Introduction ##

This page is about how to install Stunt Rally and from where to get it.

The dev team itself maintains **GNU/Linux binaries** and **Windows installer**.

Those are located on the official **[DOWNLOADS page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/stuntrally/files/)** (on SourceForge).

See details below for info how to use them.


<br>
<h2>Windows</h2>

Official installer is located in our <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/stuntrally/files/'>downloads</a>.<br>
<br>
It is an executable (.exe) that will install game (and editor) in chosen destination.<br>
After installation shortcuts will appear in start menu folder.<br>
Build is 32 bit and works on both 32 and 64 bit Windows 7 systems (others untested).<br>
Version 2.2.1 is the last one to run on Windows XP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>GNU/Linux</h2>

Official archive with precompiled binaries (32 and 64 bit) is located in our <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/stuntrally/files/'>downloads</a>.<br>
<br>
It is an .xz archive that needs to be unpacked (anywhere).<br>
Then start the game or editor running the included links (shell scripts).<br>
If this doesn't work, start them in console to see any errors. Some libraries may be missing, etc.<br>
<br>

But most of them are maintained by third-party individuals and it is not guaranteed that they are up-to-date.<br>
